I wrote this script to remove all source control bindings from a VS2010 source
tree. It's quick and dirty (including manipulating XML files with awk...) but
it works :)

It also strips specific Infragistics assembly versions from the tree, which is
probably solving a different problem in the same place, but hey, I'm lazy and
this is the first version.

I wrote it because I'm using git-tfs and don't want to tell VS to ignore stuff
every time I open a solution -- so I've opted to remove all knowledge of TFS
bindings from the solutions.

Obviously it's a bash shell script, so you need bash (probably in cygwin) to
run it.
